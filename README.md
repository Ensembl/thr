## TrackHub Registry

TrackHub Registry (THR) is a global centralised collection of publicly accessible [track hubs](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html#Intro). The goal of the project is to allow third parties to advertise track hubs, and to make it easier for researchers around the world to discover and use track hubs containing different types of genomic research data.

This repository is created to give the project a technology refresh while keeping the same core functionalities.
